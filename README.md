I don't speak English very well.<br/>

This 'Sinnori' project is aimed to implement simple back-end architecture simulation of the game company.<br/><br/>

The game company's simple back-end architecture consists of 3 part.
First part is authentication server that is based on tcp/ip.
Second part is business logic server that is based on udp.
The third part is a client API that provides the function for connecting the client to the authentication server.

- Sinnori current development  state -
(1) java application API
(2) java business logic server

client type is web aplication server, web browser, pc appliction(ex java swing appliction), smart phone appliction and etc.
Now just Sinnori support java web aplication server and java pc appliction but I dream Sinnori support all client type.

Sinnori current version uses Sinnori protocol but I hava a plan to support Google protocol buffer.
Now Mission Impossible is udp.
I don't know UDP but I trye and try.
